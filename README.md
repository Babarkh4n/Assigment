Searching 'Introduction to text' on Google.
I have noticed in Top 5 links that Google search brings up few books and wiki, Google matches the Headings with the search i belive.
Searching 'Introduction to text' on duckduckgo.
I noticed Wikipedia link in top 5 same as google but 5th and 4th search link here is not relevant to the searched topic it is giving me 'Introduction' related links.
Searching 'Introduction to text' on Bing.
I noticed nothing was to the pont here first search link shows ( Introduction to text messages ) and nothing is directing to the specified search.
As i have observed 'Introduction to text' on all three search engines i have noticed that "Google" does not add any kind of extra words to your requested search topic and it takes you to the specific headings and websites where ever the same text exists, "duckduckgo" on the other hand brings up wiki on the first link and then it starts adding as well such as introduction to text encoding and text linguistics which was not requested, along with "Bing" which straight forward gave the links which had introduction to text messaging and others unrelated topic the pattern here describes that google search ignore punctiations and refine its search which shows up the links specified to the topic bing and duckduckgo is not working in that pattern duckduck go few links are like google but bing was filling the missing text according to other search history such as Introduction to text messages.
GOOGLE is better then Bing and duckduckgo
All search engines does not return the same results
Searching "Introduction to text analysis" 
Google - specific to the point guides and libraries links.
duckduckgo - few introduction specific links but also gave me text processing and APIs related results.
Bing - slides, tools and methods also related in the search and guides.
Search suggestions observed.
Google - was more specified and suggested me exactly to the point what i was looking for in first 3 suggestions.
duckduckgo - was not linking what i was searching for 
bing - was not showing user required suggestions thus was not satisfying.
